       <summary>Cross Platform, 2D and 3D Game Engine for C# (Android, iOS, Windows, Mac).</summary>
       <description>UrhoSharp is a lightweight Game Engine suitable for using with C# and F# to create games that run on Android, iOS, Mac, Windows and Unix. The game engine is available as a portable class library, allowing your game code to be written once and shared across all platforms. UrhoSharp is powered by Urho3D (http://urho3d.github.io/), a game engine that has been under development for more than a decade.   All the samples from Urho3D have been ported to C# to help you get started: https://github.com/xamarin/urho-samples</description>
